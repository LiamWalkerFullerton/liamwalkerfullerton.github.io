### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.

* Lab 9 Part 1
    
    As you will see, many of my lab pics are recent labs. I love the new
    concepts that we have learned and in this lab we utilized the file
    editing system. I really think this is useful for parsing large amounts
    of text data or in this case creating a spelling checker. 

* Lab 10 Part 1

    I really liked this lab because it made us dive deeper into 2D vectors
    and how to parse them. Additionally we use CSV files in this which are
    one of my favorite file types due to my love of excel spreadsheets.

* Lab 11 Part 1

    I really enjoyed Lab 11 because it really brought together this class
    and what we learned from the semester started getting put together.
    Additionally I really enjoyed using the secret game formula and this was
    the best version we ended up using.
